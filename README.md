# Adventure-of-Zoria by Dominik Kaspar
A "prompt program" that makes any language model play an adventure game with you. Works best with ChatGPT and OpenAssistant. (I did not try GPT-4 because I'm broke student)

I don't know if term "prompt programming" exists or if I just made it up, it is basically what I did here. I typed in precise orders for the LLM to follow to simulate an adventure game. It is very interesting and you have direct access to the story. I will continue perfecting this prompt until the AI becomes jailbreak proof.

How to use:
  1) Locate the latest version of the prompt in the source files.
  2) Select the version for the LLM you are using (It needs to be finetuned for every model model ðŸ™ƒ)
  3) Open the text file and copy the whole prompt
  4) Create a new chat in the LLM and paste it there 
  5) Follow the instructions of the LLM and enjoy! ðŸ˜œ
