# Prompt Programs
A "prompt program" that makes any language model follow desired behaviour. Works best with ChatGPT and OpenAssistant.

I don't know if term "prompt programming" exists or if I just made it up, but that is basically what I did here. I typed in precise orders for the LLM to follow to simulate an desired behaviour.

How to use:
  1) Locate the latest version of the prompt in the source files.
  2) Select the version for the LLM you are using (It needs to be finetuned for every model model ðŸ™ƒ)
  3) Open the text file and copy the whole prompt
  4) Create a new chat in the LLM and paste it there 
  5) Follow the instructions of the LLM and enjoy! ðŸ˜œ

You are free to play with the parameters in the prompt or use this as template for your own prompt program, but please if you do, link to this repo on your own page. If you make something cool from this, I want to see it ðŸ¤“. I will add it here.
